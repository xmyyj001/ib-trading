Excellent! It looks like the deployment with your code changes was successful. Let's analyze this new log.

### Analysis of the New Build

1.  **Code Update:** You successfully pulled the changes from your Git repository. The log confirms this: `cloud-run/application/app/main.py | 36 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-`. This shows your `main.py` file was updated with the new, safer code.

2.  **Successful Build:** The Cloud Build pipeline (`ID: 0ed49cd7-e4dd-450d-8267-ad2d9052b410`) completed successfully (`STATUS: SUCCESS`). This means the Docker image was built and pushed to Artifact Registry without any errors. The crash loop during startup is fixed.

3.  **Successful Deployment (Step #4):** The new container was successfully deployed to your Cloud Run service `ib-paper`.
    ```
    Service [ib-paper] revision [ib-paper-f6dedf8] has been deployed and is serving 100 percent of traffic.
    Service URL: https://ib-paper-599151217267.asia-east1.run.app
    ```

You have successfully resolved the `AttributeError` crash loop.

### A New, Important Issue Has Been Uncovered

Now that the initial crash is fixed, your application is able to run further and is revealing the *next* problem. This is a normal and expected part of the debugging process.

Look at the log for **Step #3** (the integration test phase):

```
Step #3: Error initializing Environment: 404 Secret [projects/599151217267/secrets/paper] not found or has no versions.
```

This is the **exact same issue** I warned about in our first conversation, but now the error message is slightly different and even clearer.

*   **Previous Error:** `403 Permission 'secretmanager.versions.access' denied...` (This meant the build process wasn't *allowed* to look for the secret).
*   **Current Error:** `404 Secret ... not found or has no versions.` (This means the build process was allowed to look, but the secret literally **does not exist**).

**What this means:**
Your application code is trying to fetch a secret named `paper` from Google Secret Manager for your project `gold-gearbox-424413-k1` (`599151217267`). It cannot find this secret.

Your application will start, but any API call that relies on this secret (likely containing your Interactive Brokers credentials) will fail.

### How to Fix It

You need to create the secret that your application is looking for.

**Using the `gcloud` command line (recommended):**

1.  **Create the Secret:** First, create the secret container itself.

    ```bash
    gcloud secrets create paper --project=gold-gearbox-424413-k1
    ```

2.  **Add a Version with a Value:** Now, add the first version of the secret. The value should be the JSON string that your application expects. Replace `YOUR_USERID` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual paper trading credentials.

    ```bash
    # IMPORTANT: The single quotes around the JSON are critical
    gcloud secrets versions add paper --project=gold-gearbox-424413-k1 \
      --data-file=- <<< '{"userid": "YOUR_USERID", "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"}'
    ```
    *(Note: The `<<<` is a "here string" that passes the text as if it were a file. This is a secure way to add the secret value without saving it to a file on disk.)*

**Using the Google Cloud Console (GUI):**

1.  Go to the [Secret Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager) page in the Google Cloud Console.
2.  Make sure you are in the correct project (`gold-gearbox-424413-k1`).
3.  Click **"Create Secret"**.
4.  For the "Secret name", enter `paper`.
5.  In the "Secret value" box, paste the JSON content:
    ```json
    {"userid": "YOUR_USERID", "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"}
    ```
6.  Leave the other settings as default and click **"Create Secret"**.

### Final Step

After creating the secret (either via `gcloud` or the console), your deployed application should be able to access it and function correctly. **You do not need to redeploy your application.** The running service will be able to find the secret on its next attempt.

Try your `curl` command again:

```bash
# You may need to refresh your TOKEN if it has expired
TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" "https://ib-paper-599151217267.asia-east1.run.app/summary"
```

You should now get a proper JSON response from your application instead of an error.
